This website allows users to share music. To offer them a better experience,
they can log into the site. By doing so we collect a few information including their email and name.

They can delete their account at any time. When they do so, all their uploaded media data is deleted as well. There's no need to have an administrator
do it for them. Here's how they can delete their account along with their data:

- Log in with their email or one of their social networks that uses the same email
- Go to the account page
- Scroll to the botttom
- Click on Delete Account and confirm to delete the account and all its data

However if they need help doing so, they can contact us the following ways:

- The [About](/about) about page contains a bunch of points of contact
- Jean GÃ©rard Bousiquot on Facebook, Twitter, Intagram
- mp3pam@jgb.solution / jgbneatdesign@gmail.com

We are always available to help with anything on this site.
